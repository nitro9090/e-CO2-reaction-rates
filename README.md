# e-CO2-reaction-rates
matlab code that calculates, plots and outputs e-CO2 reactions for use in gnuplot, currently setup for a DBD plasma

This code was built for my dissertation to output the calculated e-CO2 reaction rates for an atmospheric DBD plasma.  
The final data was specifically output for use in gnuplot in order to beautify the graphs.  However, all of the data
is still available in the matlab format for use.
